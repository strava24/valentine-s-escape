# 💘 Valentine's Day Interactive Page

## Page 1: The Question
- A beautifully designed page asking **"Do you want to be my valentine?"**
- Background filled with a **collage of romantic couple stock images** arranged in an aesthetic grid/mosaic layout
- A placeholder text line beneath the question (easy to edit later)
- Two buttons: **Yes** and **No**
  - **"Yes" button**: Every time the user tries to hover or click it, it floats/jumps to a random position on the screen, making it impossible to actually click
  - **"No" button**: Clickable and redirects to a second page

## Page 2: The Video
- When the user clicks **"No"**, they're taken to a new route
- An embedded **YouTube video** auto-plays on this page (placeholder video for now, easy to swap the URL later)
- Simple centered layout with the video prominently displayed

## Design & Vibe
- Warm, romantic color palette (pinks, reds, soft whites)
- Playful animations on the Yes button (smooth random repositioning)
- Couple stock images arranged in a nice overlapping collage behind the main content
- Mobile-friendly layout
