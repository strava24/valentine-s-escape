              This year, I didn’t want it to be just another handwritten letter… something that ends up folded and kept away in a cupboard. And maybe I’ve been a little inspired by the current trend too… LOL. But more importantly, I wanted to do this in a way that feels more us. Because, after all, we are computer scientists… so here we go — the right way.

              This is our 4th Valentine’s Day together. Honestly, when I think about it, I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. No one else would have put up with me all this time — especially with me being me… a workaholic, stubborn, sometimes emotionally unavailable jerk. Yet you stayed. You understood me. You supported me. You loved me anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your understanding. And thank you for all the love you’ve given me — even during the times I didn’t deserve it enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were so many moments when I was exhausted, mentally drained, and unsure of myself. And without saying much, you were there. You gave me your shoulder to rest on. You gave me your presence, your calm, and your strength. You backed me up when I needed it the most. Honestly, without you, I wouldn’t have achieved half of what I have today — especially not in such a short time. You were never just beside me… you were part of every step forward I took.</p>
            <p>
              I also want to take this moment to give you reassurance. Just like you were there for me, I will always be there for you. Whenever you feel tired, lost, overwhelmed, or unsure — you will always have my shoulder to rest on. Don’t ever hesitate to reach out to me. You never did before, and I never will either. That’s a promise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to see you grow. I want to see you succeed in both your worlds — in art and in IT. I know how talented you are, even when you doubt yourself. And I want you to know that I will always be there, standing beside you, clapping the loudest, celebrating every achievement, every small win, and every big milestone — just like you did for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I look back at the past few years, I realize something that honestly makes me feel stupid now. I always had reasons why I couldn’t do anything special for you on Valentine’s Day. I blamed time, work, stress… everything. And yet, here I am now, doing something — even with the same busy schedule. This site literally cost me nothing except a little effort and thought. I guess the truth is… it was never about time. I just should have tried harder. And I’m truly sorry for that.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know I’ve been an asshole at times. I know I’ve hurt you, disappointed you, and taken you for granted more than I should have. But please know this — my love for you has never gone backwards. It has only grown stronger with time. And it will continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              And just like always… I know I’m a pain in your ass. But let’s be honest — you’re a pain in mine too. LOL. That’s just who we are. And honestly, I wouldn’t want it any other way.
            </p>
            <p>
              So please… keep putting up with me for many more Valentine’s Days to come. I’m looking forward to every single one of them. And I’m especially looking forward to this Sunday… because knowing you, you probably have something planned — and I can’t wait to experience it with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for being my person. <br /> Thank you for choosing me. <br /> And thank you for loving me — even on my worst days. <br /> Intha mogarakataki ithu poothum
